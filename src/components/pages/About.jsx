            My name is Raymond Rodriguez. I am 21 years old and am currently a full-time student at UC San Diego. I am majoring in mechanical engineering
            and will hopefully be graduating in June 2024. My hobbies are playing video games and hanging out with friends. My plans with coding for the
            moment are to look for any internships or part-time jobs where I can utilize my new-found skills in.
